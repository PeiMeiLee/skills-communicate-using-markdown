# Add a code example
## In addition to code blocks, some code blocks should be rendered differently depending on the language, such as JavaScript or command-line text.
### Example 1
```
$ git init
Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/skills/Projects/recipe-repository/.git/
```
### Example 2
``` javascript
var myVar = "Hello, world!";
```
# Create a task list
## What is a task list? A task list creates checkboxes to check off. They're very useful for tracking issues and pull requests. If you include a task list in the body of an issue or pull request, you'll see a progress indicator in your issue list. The syntax for task lists is very specific. Be sure to include the spaces where required, or else they won't render.
